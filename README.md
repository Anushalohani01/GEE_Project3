Methane (CH₄) Monitoring and Trend Analysis with Sentinel-5P in Google Earth Engine
Overview
This project leverages the capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor atmospheric methane (CH₄) concentrations using Sentinel-5P satellite data. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas contributing significantly to climate change. This script demonstrates how to analyze methane trends, compute anomalies, and visualize results for a specific region of interest (ROI) over a defined time frame.

Methodology

1. Region of Interest (ROI) Selection
Objective: Define a specific geographical area for methane analysis.
Dataset: The FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset is used to extract administrative boundaries.
Process: A point geometry is specified (latitude and longitude), and the ROI is extracted by filtering boundaries that intersect the point. This ensures spatial focus for analysis.

2. Data Acquisition
Dataset: The Sentinel-5P Level-3 CH₄ dataset (COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_CH4) provides global coverage of methane concentrations.
Band Selection: The CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air band is selected and renamed to methane for easier reference.
Temporal Filtering: Data is filtered for the years 2020–2024 to define the study period.
Spatial Filtering: The dataset is clipped to the ROI, reducing computational overhead.

3. Monthly Methane Aggregation
Objective: Calculate monthly average methane concentrations for each year.
Process: The dataset is iteratively filtered for each month and averaged using GEE’s mean() reducer. Metadata (system:time_start) is added for each image to facilitate time-series analysis.
Output: An ImageCollection containing monthly average methane concentrations.

4. Time-Series Analysis
Visualization: A time-series chart is generated to visualize methane concentration trends over the ROI.
Statistical Analysis: The mean methane concentration for the entire study period is computed and visualized using a color-coded map.

5. Methane Anomaly Detection
Objective: Identify deviations from the mean methane concentration.

Process:
Monthly methane anomalies are calculated by subtracting the mean methane concentration from each monthly average image.
Positive anomalies are filtered and analyzed for spatial and temporal patterns.
Visualization: A column chart displays the magnitude of anomalies, highlighting significant deviations.
Export: Positive anomalies are exported as a raster file for further analysis or reporting.

6. Methane Trend Analysis
Objective: Detect and visualize methane trends over the study period.
Method: Kendall’s Tau correlation is applied to the time series, providing a robust statistical measure of monotonic trends.
Visualization: A trend map highlights regions with increasing, decreasing, or stable methane concentrations using a diverging color palette.

Key Features
Data-Driven Approach: Integrates Sentinel-5P data for high-resolution methane monitoring.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies significant methane deviations, aiding in climate and environmental assessments.
Trend Analysis: Employs Kendall’s Tau for robust trend detection.
Customizable Workflow: Easily adaptable for different regions, time frames, or greenhouse gases.

Applications
Climate Change Research: Understanding methane concentration trends and their impact on global warming.
Environmental Monitoring: Identifying regions with significant methane emissions or anomalies.
Policy Making: Providing actionable insights for mitigation strategies and environmental regulations.
Requirements
Platform: Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API).

Datasets:
FAO GAUL (FAO/GAUL/2015/level1) for administrative boundaries.
Sentinel-5P CH₄ (COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_CH4) for methane concentrations.

Output Visualizations:
Methane concentration maps (mean and trends).
Time-series charts (monthly concentrations and anomalies).

Exported Data:
Positive methane anomalies as raster files.
Processed methane trend maps.
